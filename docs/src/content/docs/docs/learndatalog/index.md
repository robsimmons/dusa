title: Learn Datalog in Dusa
description: A recreation of the "Learn Datalog Today" tutorial in Dusa.

In 2013, Jonas Enlund made a tutorial for the [Datomic](https://www.datomic.com) dialect of Datalog called [Learn Datalog Today](https://www.learndatalogtoday.org). It's a great introduction to Datomic, and I wanted to recreate it in the Dusa programming language.

Dusa is an extension of Datalog that has more in common with [answer set programming](docs/introductions/asp/) than Datomic, but at its core Dusa does contain a Datalog-like language.
