If you've programmed in other languages, you may be used to working with functions, where you start with some inputs and produce some outputs.

These are the basic components of a Datalog program in Dusa:

* **Integers** `12` and `-31`
* **Strings** `"This is a string"`
* **Operators** like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`
* **Symbols** are a lowercase letter followed by letters, numbers, and underscores, like `result`, `bigFish13`, `pair`, or `this_is_fine`.
* **Variables** are an uppercase letter followed by letters, numbers, and underscores, like `X`, `Title`, `Sum` or `N4`.

```python
def f: pass
```
