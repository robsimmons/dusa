import Dusa from '../../../../components/Dusa.astro';

A Dusa program is a sequence of declarations.
This program has 3 declarations, and we read it as saying that `a` and `b` are immediately provable
and that `a` and `b` together imply `c`.

<Dusa predicates={['a','b','c']} code={`

# a pound sign followed by a space is a line comment

a.
b.
c :- a, b.

`}/>

All these declarations are [rules](/docs/language/rules/). The first two rules have no premises, and
the third rule has two premises (`a` and `b`), with the conclusion `c`.
