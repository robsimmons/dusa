title: Lazy predicates (experimental)
---

import Dusa from '../../../../components/Dusa.astro';

**WARNING: this is an unusually experimental feature introduced in 0.1.3 and
is likely to break, change, or be removed in future releases.**

Lazy predicates allow a limited form of "backward-chaining," or 
"Prolog-style," or "top-down" logic programming in Dusa. Normally, a program
like this one will never terminate, because you can always generate new
`nat` facts once you start generating them:

<Dusa predicates={['nat']} code={`

nat z.
nat (s N) :- nat N.

`}/>

However, by making `nat` a "lazy" predicate, we only derive the `nat` facts
that we absolutely need to run other parts of our program.

<Dusa predicates={['nat', 'p', 'q']} code={`

#lazy nat
nat z.
nat (s N) :- nat N.

p (s (s z)).
p "hello".
p 4.

q X :- p X, nat X.

`}/>

Dusa implements lazy predicates by applying a program transformation called
the "magic sets" or "demand" transformation. It's helpful to have a bit of a
mental model of how this transformation actually works. The program above is
transformed into (more or less) this program by the demand transformation:

<Dusa predicates={['nat', 'demand_nat', 'p', 'q']} code={`

#lazy nat
nat z :- demand_nat z.
nat (s N) :- demand_nat (s N), nat N.
demand_nat N :- demand_nat (s N).

p (s (s z)).
p "hello".
p 4.

q X :- p X, nat X.
demand_nat X :- p X.

`}/>

## Inputs and outputs

The simple lazy transformation currently implemented treats the arguments to
a lazy predicate as "inputs", which means that whenever they appear in a
premise they have to be bound by previous premises. The exception is the value
of a functional predicate, which is treated as an output. That allows for the
writing of (some) Prolog-style logic programs that compute values, like this:

<Dusa predicates={['plus']} code={`

#lazy plus
plus z N is N.
plus (s N) M is (s P) :- plus N M is P.

#demand plus (s (s (s (s z)))) (s (s (s z))) is N.

`}/>

Lazy predicates can refer to other lazy predicates, which enables this
Prolog-style implementation of quicksort:

<Dusa predicates={['sort', 'partition', 'append']} code={`

#lazy sort
sort nil is nil.
sort (cons X Xs) is Sorted :-
   partition X Xs is (tuple As Bs),
   append (sort As) (cons X (sort Bs)) is Sorted.

#lazy partition
partition X nil is (tuple nil nil).
partition X (cons Y Ys) is (tuple (cons Y As) Bs) :-
   partition X Ys is (tuple As Bs),
   Y <= X.
partition X (cons Y Ys) is (tuple As (cons Y Bs)) :-
   partition X Ys is (tuple As Bs),
   Y > X.

#lazy append
append nil Ys is Ys.
append (cons X Xs) Ys is (cons X (append Xs Ys)).
