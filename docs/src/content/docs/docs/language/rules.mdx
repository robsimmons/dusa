import Dusa from '../../../../components/Dusa.astro';

The most important [declarations](/docs/language/declarations/) in Dusa are rules. 
A rule has the form `<conclusion> :- <premises>`, where each premise is a 
[fact](/docs/language/fact/) and the conclusion is a [choice](/docs/language/choices/).
When a rule has no premises, the `:-` symbol is omitted.

Rules with open and closed choices as the conclusion are called, respectively,
open and closed rules.


## Premises

Premises to a rule can have the following form:

- Premises can be [facts](/docs/language/fact/) of the form `<attribute>` or `<attribute> is <term>`.
  The attribute and value can both contain free variables.
- `<term> == <term>`, which is only satisfied if the two terms can be made equal.
  Both sides of the equation can contain variables, but all the variables on one side
  or the other must have been mentioned in a previous premise.
- `<term> != <term>`, which is only satisfied if the two terms cannot be made equal.
  Both sides of the equation can contain variables, but all the variables on one side
  must have been mentioned in a previous premise, and variables first mentioned in an
  inequality premise cannot be mentioned in subsequent premises or in the conclusion.

## Closed rules

An closed rule looks like this:

```
<attr> is { <value_1>, ..., <value_n> } :- <premises>.
```

but if `n` is 1, it can be written like this:

```
<attr> is <value_1> :- <premises>.
```

If the premises of a closed rule hold, Dusa must assign the attribute to one of the
listed values. If we've already given the attribute a value, then that attribute must
be one of the listed values, or else the solution will be invalidated.

## Open rules

Open rules use the `is?` keyword instead of the `is` keyword in their conclusion.

```
<attribute> is? <value> :- <premises>.
```

It's also possible to use curly braces to make an open rule with multiple values:

```
<attribute> is? { <value_1>, ..., <value_n> } :- <premises>.
```

This rule is shorthand for writing the following `n` rules:

```
<attribute> is? <value_1> :- <premises>.
...
<attribute> is? <value_n> :- <premises>.

```

If all premises of an open rule hold, then Dusa will try to evaluate the program
further with each of the listed attributes, but will **also** leave open the option
that some other chain of reasoning might assign some different value to the attribute.

<Dusa predicates={['color', 'species']} code={`

color is { "brown", "blue" }.
species is? { "dolphin", "fish" }.
species is? "bear" :- color is "brown".

`}/>

When evaluating the first rule, the color must be blue or brown: no other possibility
is allowed when dealing with a closed rule. When evaluating the second rule, however,
there are three possibilities: the species is dolphin, the species is fish, and the
species might be determined later by some other chain of reasoning.
And indeed, the third rule allows us to derive that the species is potentially "bear"
if the color is "brown".

The program has five total solutions:

- `color is "brown"`, `species is "dolphin"`
- `color is "brown"`, `species is "fish"`
- `color is "blue"`, `species is "dolphin"`
- `color is "blue"`, `species is "fish"`
- `color is "brown"`, `species is "bear"`

If we'd made the conclusion of the last rule `species is { "bear" }` --- or,
equivalently, `species is "bear"` --- it would require that when the color is brown, the
species is bear, invalidating the brown+dolphin and brown+fish solutions. By leaving
the third rule open, it didn't invalidate solutions where a different chain of
reasoning had assigned a different species.

### Open rules don't provide extra information

When Dusa considers the "question mark path" of a derivation, it does **not** treat
the attribute as if it has some value that's not yet determined; instead, it treats
the open rule as if it hasn't ever fired. To see why this matters, consider the
following program:

<Dusa predicates={['a', 'b']} code={`

a is? { 1, 2 }.
b :- a is _.
a is? 3 :- b.

`}/>

Procedurally, Dusa must follow three chains of logic. In the first chain of logic,
Dusa derives `a is 1` as a fact, uses that to further derive `b`, and then considers
the third rule, which opens up the possibility that `a is 3`, but this cannot be
derived as it would conflict with the fact `a is 1`. In the second chain of logic,
Dusa does the same thing, but for `a is 2`.

In the final chain, if we acted like `a is ?` was true for an as-yet-unknown value,
we'd be able to use that fact to derive `b` with the second rule and then `a is 3`
with the third rule. That is **not** how Dusa works. In actuality, the third chain of
reasoning will be rejected, because no subsequent reasoning will derive any knowledge
about the value assigned to the attribute `a`.
