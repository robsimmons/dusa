title: Choices

import Dusa from '../../../../components/Dusa.astro';

[Functional facts](/docs/language/facts/) are a key part of how Dusa works: if
a solution in Dusa contains a fact like `color 3 8 is "red"` then we know it
can't  contain a fact like `color 3 8 is "black"`, because an attribute like 
`color 3 8`  is only allowed to "map" to at most one value.

Dusa allows programmers to write programs with multiple solutions by saying 
that it's possible to choose multiple attributes for a single value. Choices 
can be _open_ or _closed_. 

## Closed choices

A closed choice lists an attribute, the keyword `is` and one or more values: 
if there is more than one value, the values are surrounded by curly braces and
separated by commas.

In any solution,
the attribute _must_ have one of the listed values.

<Dusa predicates={['color']} code={`

color 1 4 is { "black", "red" }.
color 2 1 is { "black", "red" }.
color 3 8 is { "black", "red" }.

`}/>

These three closed rules mean that the program has 2 to the power of 3
solutions. 

Whenever we write a simple fact about a functional proposition in a program, 
like `color 4 7 is "red"`, that's actually describing a closed rule with just 
one choice: we could equivalently write `color 4 7 is { "red" }`.

### Closed choices describe intersections

This program has two solutions: one just containing `a is "blue"` and one just
containing `a is "orange"`:

<Dusa predicates={['a']} code={`

a is { "blue", "orange", "red" }.
a is { "blue", "orange", "green" }.

`}/>

The rules of forward chaining logic programming say that every rule that can 
fire must fire, and this program has two rules that can fire. If we imagine 
considering the first choice first, there are three potential solutions: the 
first just contains `a is "blue"`, the second just contains `a is "orange"`, 
and the third just contains `a is "red"`.

- In the first potential solution, where `a is "blue"`, there's only one valid 
  option for the second choice: choosing blue. Choosing orange or green will 
  just invalidate the potential solution. 
- Analogously, in the second potential solution where `a is "orange"`, there's
  only one valid way to make the second choice.
- In the third potential solution, where `a is "red"`, there's no way to make 
  a consistent choice, so this potential solution must be invalidated.

## Open choices

An open choice lists an attribute the keyword `is?`, and one or more values: 
if there is more than one value, the values are surrounded by curly braces and
separated by commas.

In any solution, the attribute _must_ have some value, and that attribute 
_can_ be any of the listed values... but it doesn't have to be! Open choices
are very chill.

### Open rules describe unions

The following programs all have exactly 3 solutions: `a is 1`, `a is 2`, and 
`a is 3`.

**Program 1**

<Dusa predicates={['a']} code={`

a is? { 1, 2, 3 }.

`}/>

**Program 2**

<Dusa predicates={'a'} code={`

a is? 1.
a is? 2.
a is? 3.

`}/>

**Program 3**

<Dusa predicates={'a'} code={`

a is? { 1, 2 }.
a is? { 2, 3 }.

`}/>

Because open choices don't preclude other consistent assignments, the possible
assignments are the union of the different assignments proposed by different
open rules.
