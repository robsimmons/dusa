## Idiom: picking rules

A common pattern in Dusa is having closed rules where the domain of the rule gets
repeated:

<Dusa predicates={['nameOf']} code={`

nameOf hero is { "Celeste", "Nimbus", "Luna", "Terra" }.
nameOf sidekick is { "Celeste", "Nimbus", "Luna", "Terra" }.
nameOf villain is { "Celeste", "Nimbus", "Luna", "Terra" }.

`}/>

Instead of having to repeat the list of names every time, it's desirable to have
one relation describe the possible names. Using a closed rule will not work:

<Dusa predicates={['nameOf', 'name']} code={`

name "Celeste".
name "Nimbus".
name "Luna".
name "Terra".

nameOf hero is { Name } :- name Name.

`}/>

This program will try to force mutually contradictory names on the hero! That program
is equivalent to this one, which similarly has no solutions:

<Dusa predicates={['nameOf', 'name']} code={`

nameOf hero is "Celeste".
nameOf hero is "Nimbus".
nameOf hero is "Luna".
nameOf hero is "Terra".

`}/>

Forcing incompatible names on the hero, as the last two programs did, will invalidate
the database and prevent there from being any solutions.

Using an open rule does allow us to separate the set of names from their assignment to
characters:

<Dusa predicates={['nameOf', 'name']} code={`

name "Celeste".
name "Nimbus".
name "Luna".
name "Terra".

nameOf hero is? Name :- name Name.
nameOf sidekick is? Name :- name Name.
nameOf villain is? Name :- name Name.

`}/>

The rules above allow for any of the valid names to be given to each character, but
also provide for the possibility that a different name will get assigned to the
character.
