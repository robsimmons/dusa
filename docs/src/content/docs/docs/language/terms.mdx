title: Terms
---

import Dusa from '../../../../components/Dusa.astro';

Most declarations in Dusa contain terms. If you've been following the language reference,
you've already seen numbers (`0`, `-213`, `100`) and strings
strings (`"Hello world"`, `"whatever?"`), but constructors
(`a`, `b`, `f c`, `h (f d) a`) also play an important role.

When you write a rule like `edge a b.` in Dusa, `edge` will be treated as a predicate, but
both `a` and `b` will get treated as
_constructors_ that take no arguments (we'll usually call these "constants.")

When you a rule like this:

<Dusa predicates={['rel']} code={`

rel (h (g my_fish) 4 aWalk) is 3.

`}/>

- `rel` will get treated as a predicate,
- `h` and `g` will get treated as constructors that take other terms as arguments, and
- `my_fish` and `aWalk` will get treated as constants.

Syntax highlighting gives a hint here: predicates are highlighted in a blue color, and 
constructors and constants are highlighted in a purple color.

## Variables

Rules in Dusa may contain logic variables, which start with uppercase letters.
The following rule says the `edge` relation is symmetric:

<Dusa predicates={['edge', 'self', 'node', 'path']} code={`

edge X Y :- edge Y X.

`}/>


If we have the fact `edge a b`, this rule will allow us to match `Y = a` and
`X = b` in the premise, and then use the rule to derive the fact `edge b a`.

Each variable can only be assigned one value. This rule:

<Dusa predicates={['edge', 'self', 'node', 'path']} code={`

self X :- edge X X.

`}/>

cannot make use of the fact `edge a b`, because there's no way to assign `X = a` and
`X = b` simultaneously. However, if we have the fact `edge c c`, then we can match
`X = c` and derive the fact `self c` using this rule.

All the variables in the conclusion of a rule must appear in the premises.

## Wildcards

You can use and reuse the wildcard `_` in place of a variable you don't care about.
`edge _ _` will match the fact `edge a b` and also the fact `edge c c`.

If you don't care about a variable's value, you can precede the variable name with a
wildcard: `edge _Left _Right` treats the variables `_Left` and `_Right` like
wildcards. A wildcard with a given name can only appear once in a rule. The only
purpose for naming a wildcard is documentation and readability.
