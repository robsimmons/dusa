The [POPL 2025 talk on finite-choice logic programming and Dusa](https://popl25.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2025-popl-research-papers/13/Finite-Choice-Logic-Programming)
links to this page. Here are some of the examples in the talk and how to run
them.

## Stop or continue

The "stop or continue" program shown in the talk can almost be cut-and-pasted
into Dusa: the only changes are that free variables need to be uppercased, and
that Dusa does not have an infix addition.

The simplest path is just to replace `N+1` with `s N`, and use Dusa's 
Prolog-style structured terms instead of built-in numbers:

<Dusa predicates={["run"]} code={`

run 0 is { "🛑", "🏃" }.
run (s N) is { "🛑", "🏃" } :- run N is "🏃".

`}/>

You can [explore this example on dusa.rocks](https://dusa.rocks/#jsonz=q1YqUbJSyi9IzVPSUUrJTy7NTc0DiSgrBJfkF-jmF-km5-eVZOaVpsbkxeQVleYpGChkFitUK8QofZg_e2KMkg6Y1d8co6RQqwdRoVGs4KeJW5WCla4CSJkfSAlMGKhVqRYA),
but beware: you really want to hit "pause" relatively quickly before you start
generating very large examples.

Your other option is to use Dusa's built-in addition.

<Dusa predicates={["run"]} builtins={["plus"]} code={`

#builtin INT_PLUS plus
run 0 is { "🛑", "🏃" }.
run (plus N 1) is { "🛑", "🏃" } :- run N is "🏃".

`}/>

You can [explore this example on dusa.rocks](https://dusa.rocks/#jsonz=q1YqUbJSyi9IzVPSUUrJTy7NTc0DiSgrBJfkF-jmF-km5-eVZOaVpsbkxeQVleYpGChkFitUK8QofZg_e2KMkg6Y1d8co6RQqwdRoVGs4KeJW5WCla4CSJkfSAlMGKhVqRYA)
as well: it is a little less eager to crash your browser.

### Command-line execution 

If you have [`npx` command line utility](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npx)
installed, you can run either of these examples by putting them in a file
called `run.dusa` and, on the command line, running

```
npx dusa run.dusa -n10
```

The `-n10` argument tells the `dusa` command-line utility to generate ten
solutions.

## Map generation

The central generation program example from the talk is this one:

<Dusa predicates={["reach", "next_to", "terrain", "region"]} code={`

reach "🏠".
reach R2 :-
    reach R1,
    next_to R1 R2,
    terrain R2 is "🌳".
terrain R is {"⛰️", "🌳", "🌊"} :-
    region R.
terrain R2 is {"🌳", "🌊"} :-
    terrain R1 is "🌊",
    next_to R1 R2.

`}/>

This code doesn't actually do much unless we populate the `region` and
`next_to` relations. We could do that by adding a bunch of facts, but it's
nicer to write a program to generate all the regions. These rules create
26 regions, home and every space on a 5x5 grid:

<Dusa predicates={["reach", "next_to", "terrain", "region", "dim"]} code={`

dim 1. dim 2. dim 3. dim 4. dim 5.
region "🏠".
region (coord X Y) :- dim X, dim Y.

`}/>

To populate the next-to relation, we place home adjacent to the upper-left
corner of the map, use an auxillary `delta` relation along with the built-in
addition operation to place every other region adjacent to the region to
its right and to the region below it. Finally, we force the relation to be
transitive.

<Dusa 
predicates={["reach", "next_to", "terrain", "region", "dim", "delta"]} 
builtins={["plus"]}
code={`

#builtin INT_PLUS plus
delta 0 1.
delta 1 0.
next_to "🏠" (coord 1 1).
next_to (coord X Y) (coord (plus X DX) (plus Y DY)) :-
    delta DX DY,
    dim X,
    dim Y,
    dim (plus X DX),
    dim (plus Y DY).
next_to X Y :- next_to Y X.

`}/>

The result is the example shown in the in-browser animation during the
talk.

### Additional constraints

We can add additional constraints, for example requiring that the lower-right
region be reachable. This uses a new kind of rule, a `#demand` constraint,
that is described in the paper's appendix and documented [here](/docs/language/constraints/#demand-constraints).

<Dusa 
predicates={["reach", "next_to", "terrain", "region", "dim", "delta"]} 
builtins={["plus"]}
code={`

#demand reach (coord 5 5).

`}/>

Another aesthetic preference might be to ensure that there's exactly one
contiguous ocean in every example. This is easily handled by a variant of the
canonical-representative-selection algorithm from Section 3.2 in the paper.

<Dusa
predicates={["reach", "next_to", "terrain", "region", "dim", "delta", "representative"]} 
builtins={["plus"]}
code={`

representative X is? X :-
    terrain X is "🌊".
representative Y is Z :-
    next_to X Y,
    representative X is Z,
    terrain Y is "🌊".

#demand representative _ is _.
#forbid representative _ is X, representative _ is Y, X != Y.
