description: The Dusa logic programming language.
---

Dusa is a logic programming language designed by 
[Rob Simmons](https://typesafety.net/rob/) and 
[Chris Martens](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/cmartens/),
the first implementation of finite-choice logic programming.

- If you've heard of Datalog (as implemented in systems like
  [Souffl√©](https://souffle-lang.github.io/program)), you may want to start by
  reading about how [Dusa is datalog](/docs/introductions/datalog/).
- If you've heard of answer set programming (as implemented in systems
  like [Potassco](https://potassco.org/)), you may want to start by reading
  about how [Dusa is answer set programming](/docs/introductions/asp/).
- If you have no familarity with either of these, that's okay too! You may want
  to start by reading about how
  [Dusa is a graph exploration language](/docs/introductions/graph/).
  Then you can take a look at some of the other introductions, or
  [fiddle with some of the default examples](/).
- If you're interested in the mathematics of finite-choice logic programming, our
  POPL 2025 paper by Martens, Simmons, and Michael Arntzenius may be of interest.
