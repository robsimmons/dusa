Dusa was initially developed by Rob Simmons and Chris Martens while Rob attended
[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Fall 2023. Recurse center is a
great place to think about ambitious projects like this in a supportive
environment full of interesting people!

## License

All documentation and examples in the `docs` directory and subdirectories are
MIT-licensed, but the Dusa implementation in JavaScript is, at present, only licensed
under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (see LICENSE).

Dusa is presently under the GPL is to make it easy for many people to use
the software while maintaining some ownership of software that took a
fair amount of time and expertise to develop. If the GPL is an issue for you
or your company but you'd like to use it, I'd be delighted to discuss
making that possible, and if you want to sponsor me to relicense Dusa
more permissively, I'd probably sell out pretty cheaply all things
considered, just sayin'. --- Rob
