# Hello React!

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a popular UI library for building web apps, usually single page apps. 

While you're in the editor working, Glitch is running your `start` script in the background. While you develop your application, your changes will happen 🪄 immediately in the preview window, or if you've opened it in another tab. 

Once you close the window and your remix goes to sleep, Glitch runs the `build` script. 

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `index.html`: This is the main page template React uses to build your site. When you're ready to share it or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

← `src/`: This folder contains all the files React will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder 📁

← `src/index.jsx`: This is the root of your React app. If you add libraries like [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org), you'll insert their providers here. The `<HelmetProvider`> is an example of a provider you'd use!

← `src/app.jsx`: The base for your react app, here is where the magic really happens. The router (from `wouter` 🐰) is imported here.

### Styles 🎨

← `src/styles`: CSS files add styling rules to your content. You can import CSS files directly (`import `)
